# Git & GitHub Guide

## 1. What is Version Control and Why It Matters
Version control is a system that tracks changes in a project’s files over time. It allows developers to:
- Restore older versions if needed.
- Work together without overwriting each other’s work.
- Keep a clear history of changes with context.

**Git** is a distributed version control system — every developer has a full copy of the repository, including its history.  
**GitHub** is a cloud service that hosts Git repositories and enables collaboration, code review, and automation.

## 2. Local vs Remote Repositories
- **Local repository:** The version stored on your computer. You edit, commit, and test here.
- **Remote repository:** The shared version stored online (e.g., on GitHub).

Typical workflow:  
```
Local changes → Commit → Push to Remote → Collaborators Pull
```

## 3. Branching and Why It’s Important
Branches allow independent development without touching the main production branch.

- **`main` branch**: Always stable and production-ready.
- **Feature branches**: Isolated work areas for features, fixes, or experiments.

Benefits:
- Safe parallel work.
- Easier code reviews.
- Controlled releases.

## 6. Summary
Using Git and GitHub properly helps:
- Track every change safely.
- Collaborate without conflicts.
- Maintain a clean and reviewable history.

By following branching strategies, meaningful commit messages, and PR best practices, teams can work efficiently and maintain high-quality code.
